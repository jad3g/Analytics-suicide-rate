# Analytics-suicide-rate

This code demonstrates the use of Apache Spark for data processing and analysis. It utilizes Spark's DataFrame API to load and manipulate tabular data. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Setup and Environment**: The code begins by setting up the Spark environment. It installs the necessary dependencies, including Apache Spark itself and the required Java version.

2. **Data Loading**: It loads a dataset containing information about suicide rates from a CSV file named `master.csv`.

3. **Data Exploration and Analysis**: After loading the data, the code performs various operations to explore and analyze it. This includes displaying the schema of the DataFrame, printing summary statistics, and showing the first few rows of the dataset.

4. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The code performs some basic data cleaning and transformation operations, such as removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns, and handling missing values.

5. **Statistical Analysis**: It calculates summary statistics for numerical columns and performs basic statistical analysis on the dataset.

6. **Documentation and Comments**: Throughout the code, there are comments and explanations to provide clarity on the operations being performed and the purpose of each section.

To run this code:

- Ensure you have Apache Spark installed and configured properly.
- Make sure you have the required dataset (`master.csv`) available in the specified location or update the code to point to the correct file path.
- Execute the code in a Spark environment, such as a Jupyter notebook or a Spark cluster.
